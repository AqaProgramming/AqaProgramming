### *Hey, I'm Yviskos!*

I currently am not doing much coding because
 * Lack of Ideas
 * Less motivation
 * I can't seem to learn much as of now, due to not knowing where, when, or how to learn (I have nothing to buy coding courses with)
But I'm trying to learn something probably.

I might make a project later, who knows. I'll make it when I'm good enough at programming.

'Till then, see you!
