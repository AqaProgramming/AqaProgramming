### Hey, I'm Aqa!

I currently am not doing much coding because
 * Lack of Ideas
 * Less motivation
 * I can't seem to learn much as of now, due to not knowing where, when, or how to learn (I have no computer, nor anything to buy coding courses with)
But I'm most likely learning C++ or Python.

If you want socials and stuff, check out my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/aqadragon).

I might make a project later, who knows. I'll make it when I'm good enough at programming.

'Till then, see you!
